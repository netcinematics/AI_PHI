# aDistructicUs

Within Strange_Nature, exists many phenomena we have yet to decipher.

A prime_example is the oldest of all. The darkness from which we emerge. And against the long arc of carnal experience. We somehow exist, here and now, despite the total discouragement, chaos, distortion and destruction herein.

The following is a Thought Experiment, to allow us to safely examine details of aDARKAa

## Distructopuss

The dark foreboding menace, can be softened, by mythology. In the following Thought Experiment, we safely explore strange details of aDARKa, and ways it is a discouragement to all existence.
With the fictional Distructopuss.

#### Thought Experiment 

> The slow dismantling of everything, through time - is the Distructopuss.

Encompass all discouragements to your existence, as if it were an cosmic black octopuss of ... entropy. 

Exact_Opposite of growth from light, lurks this distructive force - still eluding examination.

#### Tentacle_Dissolvant

A key aspect of this apparent cosmic tyrant - is the nature of its TENTACLES. They appear to dissolve the atoms of everything they touch.

#### Through time and size.

But there is more. The tentacles ooze through TIME at different speeds.

Think of a galactic tentacles, pulling two galaxies to collide. Or a planetary tentacle, crushing a planet with forces like heat, cold and poison.

#### Social_Tentacles

Amazingly, the force decends to Earth as Terrestrial_Tentacles. 

Across our eons of evolution. The tentacles represent the limit of our cognitive VIEWZ, and the impetus of our puzzling self-distruction. 

Then on a daily basis, the gooey oozing concepts - extend from_mind_to_mind, as Social_Tentacle

#### BIO_Tentacle

Beneath the Social Tentacle, lurks highly contagious bio tentacles, emotional_tentacles, and generational_tentacles. But those are still unexplored, and to be detailed
elsewhere.

## aSelfDistructicUs

Within the Social_Tentacles, is where the strange ACTZ of aSelfDistructivUs arise.

Both as a group and individually, sometimes - a carnal impulse arises to discourage the co-habitation - of humanity - on this otherwise lonely and cold speck of dust in space.

> WHY???

#### STRANGE_NATURE 

> What is this default of strange_nature that dinosaurs eat dinosaurs, and animals eat animals?

And why the default concept, within the carnal human mind - to discourage the co-habitant human?

> Look at the default concept

Is there no alternative concept?

THAT is the goal of these EXPERIMENTS. From here many valuable VIEWZ begin to GENERATE.

#### Same_Struggle

> In a struggle for scarcity, BOTH minds appear locked in a concept - ME_and_MINE.

Strangely. If we all have the same problem, why can we not all peacefully resolve it? 

> We sometimes prefer escalation to annihilation, over collaboration - toward DOUBLE_BETTER?

WHY???

The tentacle encroaches in the night, somehow, like actual_false_concepts move from_mind_to_mind.

#### DEFAULT_CODEZ

Amazingly. Deeper study into this reveals a concept called aGeneranza. The view that encoded concepts extend from the default carnal state (aCARNa) until now. 

> Somehow concepts transform (non-visably), through time, generationally, from animal_eat_animal to me_and_mine.

However arrived, the collection of comcepts present in society and individual mind - is some type of mental_encoding and DEFAULT_CODEZ.

#### aAUTOMATa

In Alphatax, aAUTOMATa means actual act of automatic nature. Look how deeply it is embedded in animal_eat_animal and me_and_mine.

With the hallmark nature that these default_codez (encodings) appear IMMUTABLE. Meaning the brain can only see the singular concept (solo_focus), and everything beyond that VIEW - the mind aCannotSee.

> We can only do, what WeCanSee.

Everything else, appears to rely on automatically encoded VIEWZ, for ECHO, and life-long repetition.


#### CONCEPTS_BEYOND_US

The unbelievable inverse of aAUTOMATa, is that additional concepts exist, awaiting aCanSee.

> Within the long arc of aGENERANZa, there must be more concepts_beyond_us.

## CONCLUSION 

So why aDistructicUs?

> Perhaps, because we have NO_OTHER_CONCEPT.
