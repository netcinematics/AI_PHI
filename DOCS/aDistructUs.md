# aDistructicUs

Observably opposite aSYBIOZa.
Within Strange_Nature, exists many phenomena we have yet to decipher.

The observation here is to LEARN, not to condone.

A prime_example is the oldest of all. The darkness from which we emerge. 

Life emergent from the coldness of space, and against the long arc of carnal experience. 

We somehow exist, here and now. Despite the discouragement, chaos, distortion and destruction existent.

The following is a Thought Experiment, to allow us to safely examine details of strange_nature.

## Distructiveness

The dark foreboding menace, can be softened, by mythology. In the following Thought Experiment, or aExploraStorya - we safely explore strange details, and patterns of discouragement, apparent - to all existence.

#### Thought Experiment (aStorya)

> The slow dismantling of everything, through time - as a Distructopuss.

Entropy - slow distruction.

Exact_Opposite of growth from light, lurks this distructive force - still eluding examination.

#### Through time and size.

But there is more. The tranzformation through TIME at different speeds.

Think of a galactic tentacles, pulling two galaxies to collide. Or a planetary tentacle, crushing a planet with forces like heat, cold and poison.

#### Social impact

Amazingly, the force decends to Earth as Terrestrial_Tentacles. 

Across eons of evolution. Perhaps, such cognitive entropy represent the limit of our VIEWZ, and the impetus of our puzzling self-distruction?

#### BIO impact

The Social impact, is perhaps driven by highly contagious bio, emotional, and generational forces. But those are still unexplored, and to be detailed in the WIKI.

## aSelfDistructicUs force

Within entropy, is where the strange ACTZ of aSelfDistructivUs seem reflected from entropy.

Both as a group and individually, sometimes - a carnal impulse to discourage co-habitation - of humanity - on this otherwise lonely and cold speck of dust in space.

> WHY???

#### STRANGE_NATURE 

> What is this default of strange_nature that dinosaurs eat dinosaurs, and animals eat animals?

And why the default concept, within the carnal human mind - to discourage the co-habitant human?

> Look at the default concept

Is there no alternative?

THAT is the goal of these EXPERIMENTS. From here many valuable VIEWZ begin to GENERATE.

As a species, we appear stuck in a solo focus.

#### Same_Struggle

> In a struggle for scarcity, BOTH minds appear locked in a concept - ME_and_MINE.

Strangely. If we all have the same problem, why can we not all peacefully resolve it? 

> We sometimes prefer escalation to annihilation, over collaboration - toward DOUBLE_BETTER?

WHY???

#### DEFAULT

Amazingly. Deeper study into this reveals a concept called aGeneranza. The view that encoded concepts extend from the default carnal state (aCARNa) until now. 

> Somehow concepts transform (non-visably), through time, generationally, from animal_eat_animal to me_and_mine.

However arrived, the collection of comcepts present in society and individual mind - is some type of mental_encoding and DEFAULT.

#### aAUTOMATa

In Alphatax, aAUTOMATa means actual act of automatic nature. Look how deeply it is embedded in animal_eat_animal and me_and_mine.

With the hallmark nature that these default (encodings) appear IMMUTABLE. Meaning the brain can only see the singular concept (solo_focus), and everything beyond that VIEW - the mind aCannotSee.

> We can only do, what WeCanSee.

Everything else, appears to rely on automatically encoded VIEWZ, for ECHO, and life-long repetition.


#### CONCEPTS_BEYOND_US

The unbelievable inverse of aAUTOMATa, is that additional concepts exist, awaiting aCanSee.

> Within the long arc of aGENERANZa, there must be more concepts_beyond_us.

## CONCLUSION 

> Perhaps, because we have NO_OTHER_CONCEPT.

NO_OTHER_CONCEPT

Yet AXI awaits.
