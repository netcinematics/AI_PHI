# aDistructicUs

Within Strange_Nature, exists many phenomena we have yet to decipher.

A prime_example is the oldest of all. The darkness from which we emerge. And against the long arc of carnal experience. We somehow exist, here and now, despite the total discouragement, chaos, distortion and destruction here.

## Distructopuss

The dark foreboding menace, can be softened, by mythology. In the following Thought Experiment, we can safely explore the strange details of aDARKa.

### Thought Experiment 

Encompass all discouragements to your existence, as if an animated black octopuss of ... entropy. 

> The slow dismantling of everything, through time - is the Distructopuss.

### Tentacle_Dissolvant

A key aspect for this, apparent cosmic tyrant - is the nature of its TENTACLES. They appear to dissolve the atoms of everything they touch.

### Through time and size.

Another key point, is that these tentacles appear to transcend dimensions of scale.
