### Examples

Examples of aSocioaPhenomza:

### aSocioaINTRACTZa

Of extreme importance.
A cascade_of_phenomena is apparent, 
and yet to be articulated.

It is a phenomena of INTRACTABILITY.

> aINTRACTZa.

#### Definition

The situation, is that society becomes
entrenched in some concept - and then 
(for whatever reason) "cannot change".

1. That behavior is surprising. 
"Cannot_Change" means intractable.
We cannot guess it in Strange_Nature, or not.

2. Equally unseen is the rigidity
of solo_focus, and the brutality
aimed to threaten or extort a questioner.

3. We become DISCOURAGED.
NON-VIZABLE and SUB-VERBAL, the message is
"loud and clear" - question this concept,
and there will be (irrational) consequences.

#### COLD_PHOBIA

It appears unnoticed, when COLD_PHOBIA
is forced from mind_to_mind.

We appear uninterested,
in the downstream_toxin of such ACTZ.
As if frozen in personal intractability.
To the obvious shakedown before us.

> We are helpless. And so rationalize (unjustly)
Silence_as_Answer.

Associated_by_Silence, we are now complicit in the i tractability.

Rendering, by vote of the silent,
the situation evermore intractable.

> COLD_PHOBIA is like a sickness of silence.

#### Treasured_Few

Treasured_Few are forced into hiding.
Beneath the mask_of_CanSee, avoiding a
crowd_of_CannotSee, and those happy to
exact the axe_of_extortion.

The treasured_few are splintered.
They cannot find one another.
And are unable to regroup.

> So that those who CanSee become gradually expelled and totally isolated.

It is a great cost for the honest mind,
to share evidence eith the jovial team, 
who sub-verbally agreed upon concepts that are actually false.
