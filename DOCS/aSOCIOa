#### Definition

The situation, is that society becomes
entrenched in some concept - and then 
(for whatever reason) "cannot change".

1. That behavior is surprising. 
"Cannot_Change" means intractable.
We cannot guess it in Strange_Nature, or not.

2. Equally unseen is the rigidity
of solo_focus, and the brutality
aimed to threaten or extort a questioner.

3. We become DISCOURAGED.
NON-VIZABLE and SUB-VERBAL, the message is
"loud and clear" - question this concept,
and there will be (irrational) consequences.
