# aCONCEPTZa 

A major gift to humanity is a 
generic container for all concepts.

Immense value exists in examination of:

> CONCEPTS_BENEATH_WORDS

This "atomic token" allows for 

combination with many others. 
To form a vast classification system.

---

## CONCEPTS_BENEATH_WORDS

Big surprises await humanity.
Look beyond the word, and deeply
think about the concept inferred.

Bottom line, 

> does the concept reflect actual_reality, or not?

### CONCEPT_FRACTURE

Major_shift in VIEWZ, awaits our minds,
to see how much fracture exists,
between concept and word.

> aFRACTZa

For example, a sizeable batch of words,
appears obsolete due to ambiguity, and
dillution of meaning. 

The sad part is when we continue use
of the words, expecting interpretation 
to be exact same as ours, however, the
mind_to_mind transfer results in
different VIEWZ.

> aTRANZa

Concept transfer from mind to mind.
Such aTRANZa is NON_VIZABLE,
and SUB_VERBAL. And easily evades focus.

> Language can do more, to specify,
the CONCEPT_BENEATH_WORDS, but also
transfer of concepts from MIND_to_MIND,
and much more.

### CONCEPT_SETZ

We may not realize it yet, but the
METASTATE of a concept is very 
helpful!

It is sometimes indicative of 
VIEW_STATES. But is also helpful
to spot LOGIC_FRACTURE.

### aMETASTATEa

The audacious statement that concept articulation,
is a "major gift to humanity", is mostly
talking about METASTATE_of_CONCEPTS.

There await significant mental abilities,
after the PRACTICE_of_CONCEPT_METASTATE.

Here are a few examples.

#### BEST_REFLECT_ACTUAL_REALITY

Current humanity appears to misplace 
emphasis on WHO CREATED a CONCEPT,
or how it fits into sprawling ontology,
rather than the KEY TASK at hand, which
is always the same:

> Does the CONCEPT BEST_REFLECT_ACTUAL_REALITY, or not?

A great METASTATE practice, for CONCEPTS,
is to remember to:

> Bring the FOCUS back to Actual_Reality.

#### many more

 More examples, discussed elsewhere.
