# aCONCEPTZa 

A major gift to humanity is a 
generic container for all concepts.

Immense value exists in examination of:

> CONCEPTS_BENEATH_WORDS

This "atomic token" allows for 

combination with many others. 
To form a vast classification system.

## CONCEPTS_BENEATH_WORDS

Big surprises await humanity.
Look beyond the word, and deeply
think about the concept inferred.

Bottom line, 

> does the concept reflect actual_reality, or not?

### CONCEPT_FRACTURE

Major_shift in VIEWZ, awaits our minds,
to see how much fracture exists,
between concept and word.

> aFRACTZa

For example, a sizeable batch of words,
appears obsolete due to ambiguity, and
dillution of meaning. 

The sad part is when we continue use
of the words, expecting interpretation 
to be exact same as ours, however, the
mind_to_mind transfer results in
different VIEWZ.
