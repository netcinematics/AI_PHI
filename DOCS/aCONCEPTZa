# aCONCEPTZa 

A major gift to humanity is a 
generic container for all concepts.

Immense value exists in examination of:

> CONCEPTS_BENEATH_WORDS

This "atomic token" allows for 

combination with many others. 
To form a vast classification system.

The 'Z' specifies this "remarkable"
version of the word, from the "common" version.

## CONCEPTS_BENEATH_WORDS

Big surprises await humanity.
Look beyond the word, and deeply
think about the concept inferred.

Bottom line, 

> does the concept reflect actual_reality, or not?

### CONCEPT_FRACTURE

Major_shift in VIEWZ, awaits our minds,
to see how much fracture exists,
between concept and word.

> aFRACTZa

For example, a sizeable batch of words,
appears obsolete due to ambiguity, and
dillution of meaning. 

The sad part is when we continue use
of the words, expecting interpretation 
to be exact same as ours, however, the
mind_to_mind transfer results in
different VIEWZ.

> aTRANZa

Concept transfer from mind to mind.
Such aTRANZa is NON_VIZABLE,
and SUB_VERBAL. And easily evades focus.

> Language can do more, to specify,
the CONCEPT_BENEATH_WORDS, but also
transfer of concepts from MIND_to_MIND,
and much more.

### CONCEPT_SETZ

We may not realize it yet, but the
METASTATE of a concept is very 
helpful!

It is sometimes indicative of 
VIEW_STATES. But is also helpful
to spot LOGIC_FRACTURE.

### aMETASTATEa

The audacious statement that concept articulation,
is a "major gift to humanity", is mostly
talking about METASTATE_of_CONCEPTS.

There await significant mental abilities,
after the PRACTICE_of_CONCEPT_METASTATE.

Here are a few examples.

#### BEST_REFLECT_ACTUAL_REALITY

Current humanity appears to misplace 
emphasis on WHO CREATED a CONCEPT,
or how it fits into sprawling ontology,
rather than the KEY TASK at hand, which
is always the same:

> Does the CONCEPT BEST_REFLECT_ACTUAL_REALITY, or not?

A great METASTATE practice, for CONCEPTS,
is to remember to:

> Bring the FOCUS back to Actual_Reality.

#### many more

 More examples, discussed elsewhere.

### aVECTORZa

A significant aspect of CONCEPTZ,

is the ability to GROUP the CONCEPT_SETZ,

across TIME, or Generations (of evolution).

Currently called:

> aCONCEPTaVECTORZa 

On a SPECTRUM, called aSPECTRAZa,
we can classify ALL_HUMAN_CONCEPTS.

So we can delineate CONCEPTS by
ORDER_of_EVOLUTION.

> Where various vectorz contain,
myriad setz - of conceptz, across TIME.

#### aSPECTRAZa

Across the continuum, or spectrum,
of ALL_HUMAN_CONCEPTS - we can
see spectacular things.

For example, there appears to be a 
gradual transcendence_of_concept from:

animal_eat_animal, to
me_myself_and_mine, to 
my_daily_utopia

What is interesting about that 
concept_transcendence, is that
they all appear to be of similar 
BASE_VECTORZ.

In other words, those concepts
appear to be DEFAULT_CODEZ, 
in concept vectorz, while
evolving over time.

So what does this mean?

> It appearz we evolve our concepts 
generationally, and individually,
off of whatever default_codes, 
we are born into.

#### CONCEPTZ_BEYOND_US

It should be common to say,
words from a distant vector.

> The idea, is that conceptz exist
whether we cansee them or not. 
Basically, they await us to see them.

So, we should welcome concepts that
originate from vectors closer to actual_reality.

> Do we celebrate words of increasing clarity,
and concepts that better reflect actual_reality?
Not so much. 

Current views appear stuck in
concepts like:
- difference_is_defense
- brilliance_is_crazy
- ignorance_is_power

Of such a high repetition, solo_robotic,
default_code - it is reasonable such a mind
can never change to conceptz_from_diztant_vector.

It is reasonable for many,
that such a stuckness of concept_sets,
will last a lifetime.
