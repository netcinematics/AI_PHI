### Most important words ever?
We take language for granted.

> Twists in language, limit concept evaluation. And clarification of language - transcends current human intelligence.

Historically, we could not evaluate max complexity of a situation. We had to simplify concepts, to save time - and move forward. AI changes this.

Such simplifications of concept are detectable in TEXT as SOCIAL_PHRASES.

### SOCIAL_PHRASES

Study of social idioms reveals something striking. It is MEASURE of how often (and to what depth), we transfer concepts socially. 

> And the amazing degree to which WE DO NOT RE-EVALUATE CONCEPTS - as the social_phrase is used repeatedly.

It was once seen as "a backdoor to all human mind". However, it grew to something much more. Described here.
